         <p>I'm currently a senior at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign doing what any soon-to-be graduate is doing: rushing to find a job and making the most of my time left at school.   
         </p>
         <p>
         My expected graduation date is in December 2018, so my time to do the above items is shorter than average. My background is in engineering physics and mechanical engineering, but I have experience in civil engineering and data analysis from previous internships. The latter of those two roles is what I am maninly interested in. Over the course of the summers of 2018 and 2017 I have devoted to learning and becoming familiar with Visual Basic, SQL, and databases. I have used this knowledge to help the company modernize several of their practices by automating certain processes, recommending specific ways to standardize their data and records, and having my final project be to develop a demo to present the potential capabilities of using a SQL database rather than a file-sharing platform. 
         </p>
         <p>
         I believe that my backgound in physics gives me a great advantage to learning and tackling new concepts with relative ease. As a phyics major, I was exposed to solving problems on a daily basis. The biggest assest I can bring to the workplace is connect two disparate subjects to solve problems. In school, we learned the similarities between thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and cuitcuits and also something completely different as quantum harmonic oscillation and a spring moving back and forth. This type of teaching environment preparded me to tackle on challenges outside the box.
